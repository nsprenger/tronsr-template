ALLE EXCHANGE has created an exclusive loyalty program, in which you receive Daily Rewards, Pop Rewards, and Lucky Seven Rewards, as a “thank you” for your amazing support. You are eligible for Daily Rewards by casting your votes for us. As a bonus, your same votes make you eligible for our exclusive Pop Rewards. Finally, you will receive additional AQA rewards for being our loyal voter. Please see below for all the details.

# DAILY REWARDS

We want to be the reason you smile every day by giving you 5% daily rewards.
As we approach the BIG DAY - the Launch of ALLE Exchange - we will reduce the rewards on a weekly basis by 0.25%.

# POP REWARDS

## 1 POP – 20,000 AQA
Vote and hold [5,000 - 5,000,000 TRX] for 1 week to earn [20,000] AQA.

## 2 POPS – 30,000 AQA
Vote and hold [5,000 - 5,000,000 TRX] for 2 weeks to earn [30,000] AQA.

## 3 POPS – 50,000 AQA
Vote and hold [5,000 - 5,000,000 TRX] for 3 weeks to earn [50,000] AQA.

## 4 POPS – 90,000 AQA
Vote and hold [5,000 - 5,000,000 TRX] for 4 weeks to earn [90,000] AQA.

The PRs are reset every 4 weeks. So, in other words, in Week 5 [after your initial votes are casted and held for ALLE EXCHANGE] you will be eligible for 1 pop [20,000 AQA].

# LUCKY SEVEN REWARDS

Voters will be receiving Lucky Seven Rewards on the 1st day of every month after the end of your 1st month. Voters will receive 7% AQA per total AQA held in your account on the first day of every month. Voters have to be held for the entire month before you become eligible for Lucky Seven Rewards (i.e. Votes cast on November 1 will be eligible for Lucky Seven Rewards on December 1 if held for the entire month, votes cast on November 12 will be eligible for Lucky Seven Rewards January 1). Eligibility requirements were created to reward our most loyal voters, so please do not withdraw any AQA from your account, if you would like to receive your monthly Lucky Seven Rewards.

# REWARDS STRUCTURE EXAMPLE:

If you have 100,000 TRX Votes for ALLE EXCHANGE and 100,000 AQA [held for 1 month without any withdrawals], you will be eligible to receive the following in 1 month:
- Daily Rewards: 5,000 AQA x 7 days [for the first week] + 4,750 AQA x 7 days [for the second week] + 4,500 AQA x 7 days [for the third week] + 4,250 AQA x 7 [for the fourth week] = 129,500 AQA
- Pop Rewards [4 weeks]: 20,000 AQA [Pop 1] + 30,000 AQA [Pop 2] + 50,000 AQA [Pop 3] + 90,000 AQA [Pop 4] = 190,000
- Lucky Seven Rewards [1st of the month]:7,000 AQA
- Total received by voter [address]: 326,500 AQA
*We will have a rewards calculator on ALLE Exchange and the Eligibility Web Portal soon!
